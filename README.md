<i>Melanie-III was developed by Alejandro Alonso on September2004.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
Melanie is an hexapod robot of 3 degrees of freedom by leg, that by the novel design of legs it has, can transport several kilograms on its body without electrical power overload.<br />

<br />
Melanie-III is an evolution of <b><u><a href="http://automacomp.blogspot.com.es/2004/04/melanie-ii-robust-hexapod-robot-of-3.html">Melanie-II</a></u></b>, to which some interesting capacities have been added,<br />
<br />
With the feedback from its 30 sensors for measuring physical values like joint positions, leg contact and current consumption and its algorithms for rough terrain avoidance, the robot is able to walk over non-regular terrain maintaining a constant speed (see Video "walking over stones" below), as well as adapt its gate to terrains with holes (see Video "<a href="https://youtu.be/Cl6G_STcm2E">Slatted surface walking</a>" and "<a href="https://youtu.be/O6VCSf8G-X0">walking over stones</a>").<br />
<br />
Moreover, its capacity to generate movements via direct programming makes it possible to use the robot for testing complex gaits or for using it as an animatronic.<br />
<br />
The control of the robot is done from an external computer. A wireless link allow the computer and robot to be properly communicated at a distance up to 100 meters.<br />
